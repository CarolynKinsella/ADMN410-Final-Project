	<dt><b><i>History:</dt></i>
	<dd>-The Durham House of Pets was founded in 19999 by Blake Enron. Blake had two dogs of her own, Debit and Credit, who were her inspiration in opening the store. Her early success selling dog products propelled Blake into the cat and fish industry, expanding her inventory and reputation astronomically. </dd>
	<br>
	<dd>- While the Durham House of Pets has expanded exponentially since its humble beginnings, Blake and the other employees put all of their effort into insuring a wonderful shopping experience for every customer and their pet. We hope you will stop by and get to know us! </dd>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<dt><i>Why Us?:</dt></i>
	<dd>- Here at The Durham House of Pets, we pride ourselves in offering nothing but the best when it comes to everything from customer service, to the quality of our products. Every member of our staff must graduate from a rigorous, ten week intensive training program, insuring everyone here at The Durham House of Pets is one hundred percent ready and qualified to serve you and your animal friends.</dd>
	<br>
	<dd>- In addition to world class customer service, The Durham House of Pets donates ten percent of proceedes to a different charitable organization every month. Make A Wish, Change, and Best Buds at UNH, are just a few of the great causes we have been able to give back to with the help of our customers!</b></dd>
